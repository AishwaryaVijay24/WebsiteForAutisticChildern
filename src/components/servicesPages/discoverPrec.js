                            <p className="p1">It's important to note that autism is a neurodevelopmental condition, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to treatment or support. The strategies and interventions that are effective can vary widely from person to person.
                            Every individual with autism is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's essential to approach each individual with autism holistically and tailor interventions to their specific needs and strengths. Consulting with healthcare professionals, therapists, and educators who are experienced in autism can provide valuable guidance.</p>
